# M1-DV2-Fundamentals
Added functionality to an existing project including a Face behavior which is shown on seeker in red. A separator shown in Navy who stops when separated. A wanderer shown in pink which wanders aimlessly. Finally, the target is shown in brown for the behaviors it is applicable too. For the wanderer, I used an invisible target which is moved to the location I want the wanderer to head towards.
